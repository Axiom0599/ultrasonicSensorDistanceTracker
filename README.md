What did I learn?

If your pycharm says that the pyserial module is not found but you are certain that you have everything installed, Right-click on the file name and click on the small error icon sort of thing that's there, and a list of options appears; just select the install option.

Quit your Arduino file if you want to run pycharm-pyserial in parallel. Otherwise, you get a port busy error.
